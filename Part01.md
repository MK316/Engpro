### _Q2. Listening and Speaking?_
+ The image below is a conceptual diagram that illustrates how **our sensory experiences** are processed within the brain. It presents five boxes, each depicting a different sense: Touch, Vision, Hearing, Smell, and Taste. These are represented by simple icons: a hand for touch, an eye for vision, an ear for hearing, a nose for smell, and a mouth for taste.
+ Each box is connected to a central image of a brain, indicating that the sensory information from these organs is sent to the brain. There are two labeled arrows leading to and from the brain: one reads "Perception," suggesting that **the brain interprets the sensory data;** the other reads "Articulation," implying that **the brain is also involved in the expression or response to these senses.**
+ This diagram emphasizes that while our sensory organs gather information from the environment, it is **ultimately in the brain where this information is actually 'sensed' or experienced.**
